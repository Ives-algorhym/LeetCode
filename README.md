# LeetCode Solutions in Swift

This repository contains my personal solutions to selected [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems implemented in Swift. Each solution is written with clean architecture principles in mind and includes unit tests using XCTest.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- ✅ Data Structures: Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Queues, Stacks
- 🔄 Algorithms: Sorting, Recursion, BFS, DFS, Dynamic Programming
- 🧪 Test-Driven Development: All code is covered by XCTest unit tests
- 🛠 Organized by topic, with dedicated folders per concept

🚧 Work In Progress

This is an evolving project. I’m continuously adding:
	•	More problems and solutions
	•	More structured unit tests
	•	Benchmarking and performance analysis

📚 Goals
	•	Practice algorithmic problem-solving in Swift
	•	Master Test-Driven Development (TDD)
 	•	Prepare for iOS software engineering interviews (e.g., Meta, Apple, Amazon)
